# Koneta source-trace tools

These tracked scripts operate on the local-only cards in
`workbench/koneta-stock/` without adopting or publishing them.

- `mine_transcripts.py` mines recent Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity JSONL
  turns and writes draft cards with source locators. The lookback is enforced
  on each turn timestamp, not only on the containing log file's mtime. A
  previously mined session may yield a later, new turn; deduplication is based
  on the full-turn quote hash rather than treating the whole session as spent.
- `backfill_source_trace.py` finds a unique raw turn for an existing card. It
  defaults to a dry run; `--write` is required to update cards.
- `audit_source_trace.py` verifies that every `exact` card still points to an
  existing raw turn and reproduces the stored quote hash.
- `sync_stock_status.py` inspects published articles in `content/` and
  synchronizes `status: published` to matching cards in `workbench/koneta-stock/`.
- `generate_manga_prompt.py` compiles deterministic 4-panel manga prompts from
  `config/koneta/manga_render_contract.yaml`.

## Source-trace contract

An exact trace stores the source platform, complete session UUID, absolute raw
log path, timestamp, one-based turn index, user/model line numbers, and a
SHA-256 quote hash calculated from the unabridged user and model messages.

Use `ambiguous` when more than one raw turn matches and `missing` when none do.
Unverified locator fields remain empty; they are never inferred from card copy
or relay prompts. The miner resolves candidate user messages against all raw
logs for that agent before assigning `exact`.

The draft cards and raw logs stay ignored by Git. Only the deterministic tools
and their contract are versioned here.
